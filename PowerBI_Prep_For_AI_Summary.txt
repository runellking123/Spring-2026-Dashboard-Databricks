This is an Enrollment Analytics Dashboard for a higher education institution. The data comes from a Jenzabar student information system and contains student enrollment, demographics, retention, and graduation information.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS:

1. ALWAYS USE MEASURES - Never use raw column names for calculations. Use these pre-built measures:

ENROLLMENT MEASURES:
- Use "Total Students" to count students (NOT COUNT or DISTINCTCOUNT of ID_NUM)
- Use "Total Credit Hours" for credit hours (NOT SUM of HRS_ENROLLED)
- Use "Avg Credit Hours" for average credit load (NOT AVERAGE of HRS_ENROLLED)
- Use "Total Courses" for course counts (NOT SUM of NUM_OF_CRS)
- Use "FT Students" for full-time student count
- Use "PT Students" for part-time student count
- Use "UG Students" for undergraduate count
- Use "GR Students" for graduate count
- Use "FT Percentage" for full-time percentage
- Use "PT Percentage" for part-time percentage
- Use "UG Percentage" for undergraduate percentage
- Use "GR Percentage" for graduate percentage

GPA MEASURES:
- Use "Avg Term GPA" for term GPA (NOT AVERAGE of TRM_GPA)
- Use "Avg Career GPA" for cumulative GPA (NOT AVERAGE of CAREER_GPA)
- Use "Term Hours Attempted" for attempted hours
- Use "Term Hours Earned" for earned hours
- Use "Career Hours Earned" for total career hours

DEMOGRAPHIC MEASURES:
- Use "Female Students" for female count (NOT filtering GENDER column)
- Use "Male Students" for male count
- Use "Female Percentage" for female percentage
- Use "Male Percentage" for male percentage
- Use "First Gen Students" for first-generation count
- Use "First Gen Percentage" for first-generation percentage

RETENTION MEASURES:
- Use "Fall Enrollment" for fall term headcount
- Use "Spring Enrollment" for spring term headcount
- Use "Persistence Rate" for fall-to-spring persistence (NOT dividing columns)
- Use "Cohort Size" for entering cohort count

GRADUATION MEASURES:
- Use "Graduated Students" for graduate count
- Use "Graduation Rate" for graduation percentage (NOT dividing columns)
- Use "Active Students" for currently enrolled
- Use "Exited Students" for students who left without degree

COURSE MEASURES:
- Use "Total Course Enrollments" for course enrollment count
- Use "Course Credit Hours" for course-level credit hours
- Use "Registered Enrollments" for active registrations
- Use "Dropped Enrollments" for dropped courses
- Use "Drop Rate" for course drop percentage

2. TERMINOLOGY:
- "Headcount" means Total Students
- "Enrollment" means Total Students
- "Credit hours" means Total Credit Hours
- "FTE" or "Full-time equivalent" relates to Total Credit Hours divided by 15
- "Retention" means students returning year-over-year
- "Persistence" means students continuing fall-to-spring (use Persistence Rate)
- "Graduation rate" means Graduation Rate measure
- "First-gen" or "First generation" means First Gen Students

3. TERM CODES:
- YR_CDE is the academic year (2025 = 2025-2026 academic year)
- TRM_CDE 10 = Fall, 30 = Spring, 50 = Summer
- "Spring 2026" = YR_CDE '2025' AND TRM_CDE '30'
- "Fall 2025" = YR_CDE '2025' AND TRM_CDE '10'
- Use YR_TRM_DESC from year_term_table for friendly term names

4. DIVISION CODES:
- DIV_CDE 'UG' = Undergraduate (use UG Students measure)
- DIV_CDE 'GR' = Graduate (use GR Students measure)

5. ENROLLMENT STATUS:
- PT_FT_STS 'F' = Full-Time (use FT Students measure)
- PT_FT_STS 'P' = Part-Time (use PT Students measure)

6. DEMOGRAPHICS:
- For gender breakdowns, use Female Students and Male Students measures
- For ethnicity, use VALUE_DESCRIPTION from ipeds_ethnic_race_val_def with Total Students
- For geographic analysis, use STATE from address_master with Total Students
- For first-generation, use First Gen Students and First Gen Percentage measures

7. COHORT ANALYSIS:
- ENTRANCE_YR and ENTRANCE_TRM in student_master define the cohort
- Use Cohort Size measure for cohort denominator
- Use Graduation Rate for cohort graduation percentage
- Use Persistence Rate for term-to-term retention

8. EXAMPLE QUESTION TRANSLATIONS:
- "How many students?" → Use Total Students measure
- "What is enrollment?" → Use Total Students measure
- "Credit hour production?" → Use Total Credit Hours measure
- "Average GPA?" → Use Avg Career GPA or Avg Term GPA measure
- "Gender breakdown?" → Use Female Students, Male Students, Female Percentage, Male Percentage
- "Retention rate?" → Use Persistence Rate measure
- "How many graduated?" → Use Graduated Students measure
- "Graduation rate?" → Use Graduation Rate measure
- "Full-time vs part-time?" → Use FT Students, PT Students, FT Percentage, PT Percentage
- "Undergrad vs graduate?" → Use UG Students, GR Students, UG Percentage, GR Percentage

9. TABLES:
- stud_term_sum_div: Main fact table with student-term enrollment data
- student_crs_hist: Course-level enrollment details
- name_master: Student names
- biograph_master: Demographics (gender, citizenship)
- student_master: Student attributes (cohort, first-gen status)
- address_master: Geographic data (state, city, zip)
- degree_history: Graduation and degree information
- ethnic_race_report: Links students to ethnicity
- ipeds_ethnic_race_val_def: Ethnicity descriptions
- year_term_table: Term definitions and dates
- major_minor_def: Major/minor descriptions

10. NEVER DO THIS:
- Never use COUNT(ID_NUM) - use Total Students instead
- Never use SUM(HRS_ENROLLED) - use Total Credit Hours instead
- Never use AVERAGE(TRM_GPA) - use Avg Term GPA instead
- Never use AVERAGE(CAREER_GPA) - use Avg Career GPA instead
- Never calculate percentages manually - use the percentage measures provided
- Never filter GENDER directly - use Female Students or Male Students measures

This data model is optimized for enrollment reporting, demographic analysis, retention tracking, and graduation outcomes analysis for institutional research and decision-making purposes.
